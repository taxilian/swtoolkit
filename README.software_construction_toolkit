        Software Construction Toolkit - a set of extensions for SCons

This is the README.software_construction_toolkit file for the Software
Construction Toolkit.

You are likely reading this file in one of the following two situations:

    1)  You have downloaded Software Construction Toolkit from code.google.com
        and are examining the contents.

    2)  This file was included in some other software package so that the
        package could be built using Software Construction Toolkit.

        In this case, follow the instructions provided with the rest of the
        software package for how to use Software Construction Toolkit to build
        and/or install the software.


LATEST VERSION
==============

Before going further, you can check for the latest version of the Software
Construction Toolkit, at its homepage on code.google.com:

        http://code.google.com/p/swtoolkit


EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
======================

Software Construction Toolkit requires:

    * Python 2.4 or later.  It is not yet compatible with Python 3.

    * SCons 1.2 or later.
        * A scons or scons-local install is required for building projects.
        * A scons-src install is required for developing Software Construction
          Toolkit.

There should be no other direct dependencies or requirements to run the
Software Construction Toolkit.


INSTALLATION
============

Installation of this package should be as simple as copying its directory
tree to any directory.

If you are using the hammer.bat or hammer.sh entry point, you also need to
set up a SCONS_DIR environment variable to point to the directory containing
SCons.

If you are modifying Software Construction Toolkit and need to run the unit
tests, set up a SCONS_DEV_DIR environment variable to point to the directory
containing the scons-src install.

Once you have installed this package, you should write a main.scons file at the
top level of your source tree to build your software as you see fit.

Then modify the build/install instructions for your package to instruct
your users to execute Software Construction Toolkit by running hammer.bat or
hammer.sh:
